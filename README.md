# Maze.py
Maze.py is a python program which solves any maze in the least iterations and finds the optimal solution using either DFS (Depth-First-Search) or BFS (Breadth-First-Search) to get the solution for the given maze written in the maze.txt file and then outputs the solution to the terminal as well as in a image file. FYI this is also one of many exmaples for Artificial Intelligence (AI).
### Getting Started
Type this line in your terminal to run the program and input your maze.txt like this:

```
python3 maze.py maze.txt
```
You can also input your own maze by editing the maze.txt in such way that: # is a wall, A is the starting point and B is the goal.
To check the solution for the maze and see all the moves done by the algorithm view the maze.png or for more info see the terminal.
