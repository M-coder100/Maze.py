# Maze.py
Maze.py is a python program which solves any maze in the least iterations and finds the optimal solution using either DFS (Depth-First-Search) or BFS (Breadth-First-Search) to get the solution for the given maze written in the maze.txt file and then outputs the solution to the terminal as well as in a image file.
### Getting Started
Type this line in your terminal to run the program and input your maze.txt like this:
```python3 maze.py maze.txt```
